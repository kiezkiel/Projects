Run responder and point it to where your target connected example eth1 and you need to be on same network

now you will expect to see an IP on 

Responder IP [] <-- use the ip inside of this to windows machine and write it on quick access //<ip from responder ip>

And it might ask you a username or password or maybe not and then after that the hash will be captured
